# AI Disease Prediction System

This project is a simple Machine Learning–based system that predicts the most likely disease based on the symptoms entered by the user. 
The aim was to build a beginner-friendly AI model that shows how real-life medical prediction systems work on a small scale.

The program uses a Naive Bayes classifier to learn from a small dataset of symptoms and diseases. 
When the user inputs symptoms, the model processes them and predicts the health condition that matches the most.

##  Features
- Accepts symptoms from the user
- Shows the full list of valid symptoms
- Machine Learning (Naive Bayes) model used
- Clean, simple and beginner-friendly Python code
- Dataset included directly inside the script
- Instant prediction output

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- MultiLabelBinarizer for symptom encoding

---

##  How to Run
1. Install the required packages: pip install scikit-learn pandas
2. Run the script using:python aiml.py
3. Enter symptoms separated by commas.
