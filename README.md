# AI Disease Prediction System

This project is a simple Machine Learning–based system that predicts the most likely disease based on the symptoms entered by the user. 
The aim was to build a beginner-friendly AI model that shows how real-life medical prediction systems work on a small scale.

The program uses a Naive Bayes classifier to learn from a small dataset of symptoms and diseases. 
When the user inputs symptoms, the model processes them and predicts the health condition that matches the most.
